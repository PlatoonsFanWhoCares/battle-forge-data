This unit represents the 'lowest common denominator', of what the best late roman units were like, which is legionaries that are simply better trained",

Indeed, Emperor Zeno (Ruled 474-475) was an Isaurian himself. Despite the fact that within the military, barbarians and romans were increasing indistinguishable, the 'Romans' in Constantinople erupted into what was effectively a race riot in 475 (Which literally started in a chariot stadium..), during which they killed every Isaurian in the city. Zeno ended up ruling from 476 till 491, when he died of natural causes. A fellow Isaurian was not allowed to replace him (More sports fans race riots), and the resulting Isaurian revolt was crushed in 492.",
